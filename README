Sometime back I read on an embedded forum that using malloc on an 8051 is a bit much for that tiny machine. Before that
while I knew how to use malloc, I didn't know how it is actually implemented. Even before that, I had read somewhere 
about the beautiful data structure that is skip list[1][2] (Thanks to Igor!), a probablistic data structure that works almost as good as a 
balanced binary tree but is far more easy to implement. And here it is then, a custom malloc[3], thanks to Dan for a great primer, implemented with a modified skip list.
I think I learned a bit.

Finally, to build this just clone the project and type `make`.

This will compile the tests. But before you can run them, you need to export the library path like this:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="~/projects/salmalloc/build/"

And then just go to `tests/build` and run test cases.

To do: Update insert. Update salfree. Add more test cases. Add regression.
